<h1> Best Social Impact Award Winner </h1>
<h2>Codespace Hackathon</h2>
In the codespace hackathon, we made an app to make the lives of Alzheimer's patients and their respective families much easier and tension free by providing a means for the families to track where the person suffering from Alzheimers is . And for the Alzheimer's Patient, the app provides a way to contact loved ones if he/she is lost and the app even provides a functionality to book an ola ride or get the path to home by just one touch.
